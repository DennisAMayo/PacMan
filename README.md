# PacMen

This is an interactive code that allows you to add pacmen and watch them float across the screen.  I added on the original exercise by adding some css to the buttons and background.  Also the pacmen now change direction when returning to the left side of the screen and the mouth opens and closes.

## How to Run
Open up the <a href="https://dennisamayo.github.io/PacMen/">PacMen</a>.  Next you will click on the "Insert Coin" at the bottom of the screen to create a new pacman, you can add as many as you want.  Then you will hit "Start Game" to have them move around the screen.


## Future Releases

- Make the transition between open and close of the mouth smoother.
- Limit the number of setTimeouts so the pacmen dont go crazy after spamming "Start Game."
